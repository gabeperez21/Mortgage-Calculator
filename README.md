# Mortgage-Calculator

This is a simple mortgage calculator for a fixed rate mortgage. You will need three files for the program to work. You can use the .exe to try out the program, or open the Lab13a.cpp file, the Mortgage.h file, and the Mortgage.cpp file together to review the code.

The program will ask the user to enter the starting loan amount, the annual interest rate in decimal form, and the length of the loan in years.

The program will then calculate how much you will need to pay each month and how much you will need to pay by the end of the loan.

While creating this program, I learned how to create a class and class object. I also learned how to create a h. file and .cpp file for the class.
